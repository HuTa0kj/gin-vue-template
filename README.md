An extremely simple background template based on Vue3 + Gin + Element UI Plus.

It has built-in basic functions such as JWT authentication, API Token, routing management, and permission control.It does not have many extra features, but includes extensible interfaces and configurations.Very highly customizable!

```bash
git clone git@github.com:HuTa0kj/gin-vue-template.git
cd gin-vue-template
docker compose up -d
```
